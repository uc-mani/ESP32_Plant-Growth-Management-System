# ESP32_Plant-Growth-Management-System
The ESP32-based plant growth monitoring and management system is an automated solution designed to monitor and adjust environmental conditions to ensure optimal growth for plants in controlled environment.

By integrating various sensors to measure critical parameters such as:
-  Temperature and Humidity Sensor
-  Air Quality Sensor
-  Soil Moisture Sensor
  
The system continuously assesses the plant environment and controls actuators to maintain ideal conditions such as:-
- Water pump
- Humidifier
- Fan (optional)
